# My Project (Rhythm Games Collection)
Do you know rhythm games? It's a kind of games that requires you to react with the rhythm of music.

I think it's enjoyable to see the improvement of scores while being immersed in favorite musics.

The rhythm game I mainly playing is called maimai DX, it's an arcade game with 8 buttons and a touch screen.

You can find one at the game center of the AEON Tomigaoka.

I've uploaded a video of myself while playing this game, hopefully it could help you understanding how it was played.

There are thousands titles of rhythm games, available on arcades, game consoles and PCs.

What kind of rhythm games have you played or heard of? Please tell me by sending a pull request to this repository.

Also, it's welcomed to send me some photos or videos of your played games.
